How to do:
- Probably create one function to do everything? I don't think it would be more efficient to have a function for each choice.
- Create empty strings for each choice
- Use Math.floor(Math.random * [whatever the total number of options is]) to create a random number
- EITHER create array to store possible answers and .push() them based on the random number
- return concatenation of all strings
